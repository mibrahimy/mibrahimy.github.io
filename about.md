I have 3 years of experience working on classification, and object detection problems using Deep Learning. I have also optimized these algorithms to achieve lesser inference time and allow scalable solutions on NVIDIA Desktop GPUs and Jetson series. I offer my services and you can contact me on my email.






Technologies I have worked with:

- C++
- Python
- [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
- CUDA
- [DeepStream](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk)
- [Gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
